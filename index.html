            <h2>What does Biztech Labs do?</h2>
            <p>We help educate students on how technology can be used in many different domains they might be interested in. We increase students awareness with our own educational workshops and student competitions where they will learn how to work in groups to solve a real world problem in areas like health and wellbeing, finance, education and more.</p>


            <p>Whether it's coming up with a concept to improve the health and wellbeing sector, looking at a new idea for a financial company, or just coming along to grow their education in technology, we encourage all with an interest in technology to come along to create, innovate and be inspired by the possibilites of this industry.</p>
